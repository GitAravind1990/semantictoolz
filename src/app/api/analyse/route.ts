CATEGORY MAPPING (MANDATORY):
- If issue mentions: schema, meta tag, HTML structure, markup → category: "technical"
- If issue mentions: author, credentials, expertise, author schema → category: "eeat"
- If issue mentions: undefined terms, entities, links to concepts → category: "entities"
- If issue mentions: unsourced claims, citations, attribution, reviews, evidence → category: "citations"
- If issue mentions: vague, shallow, lacking details, weak explanations → category: "semantic"

PAGE SIGNALS:
Content fetched from a URL begins with a "=== PAGE SIGNALS ===" block listing what the page's
HTML declares: title, meta description, canonical, structured data types, author markup, dates
and heading outline. Score technical_seo, on_page_seo, structured_data and eeat_signals from
that block — it is the only evidence of markup, because the tags themselves are stripped before
the body text reaches you. A field marked MISSING or NONE FOUND is a genuine absence and should
be scored and reported as one. When the block is not present the content was pasted directly,
so judge those four dimensions on the text alone and say so rather than assuming the markup is
absent.
Never quote the block back as if it were body copy, and never treat it as content to score for
readability.

RULES:
- overall_score: 0-100
- grade: S(90+) A(80+) B(70+) C(55+) D(<55)
- top_issues: 5-7 ranked by impact
- EVERY issue MUST have a category field inside JSON
- Do NOT append category to fix text
- Return ONLY JSON`
