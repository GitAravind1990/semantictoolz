  {
    title: '1. Acceptance of Terms',
    body: `By creating an account or using Optmizly ("Service"), you agree to these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the Service. These terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Optmizly.`,
  },
  {
    title: '2. Description of Service',
    body: `Optmizly provides content analysis and SEO tools. Some tools use large language models to analyse content and generate recommendations. Others report measured data retrieved from third-party providers, including search volume, keyword difficulty, rankings, backlink and domain metrics, page performance data, and — where you connect it — your own Google Search Console data. Results are provided for informational purposes only and do not guarantee specific SEO outcomes. AI-generated recommendations are probabilistic and may not always be accurate. Third-party data is provided as supplied to us and we do not warrant its accuracy or completeness. Both should be reviewed before implementation.`,
  },
  {
    title: '3. Account Registration and Plans',
    body: `You must create an account to use Optmizly. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity under your account. Free accounts are limited to 3 analyses per month. Starter accounts are limited to 15 analyses per month and include the same tools as the Pro plan. Pro accounts are limited to 50 analyses per month. Agency accounts are limited to 200 analyses per month. Agency Plus accounts are limited to 500 analyses per month, include unlimited client records and 5 seats, and allow 10 SEO Client Finder searches per day. Most tools count as one analysis. Tools that make more third-party API calls on your behalf count as two or three, and each one tells you its cost before you run it. Counting as three: Keyword Research, Competitor Spy, Ranking Engine, Geogrid and the Local SEO suite. Counting as two: Backlinks, Rank Tracker, SERP Audit, Review Velocity, Client Reports, AI Visibility, Content Gap and Content Planner. Unused analyses do not roll over. Agency accounts may hold up to 10 client records at a time for client reporting; removing a client frees its place, and client records do not consume analyses. Agency accounts include 2 seats, counting the account owner: a second person may be invited to work in the same account, sharing its clients, analyses and monthly allowance. Only the account owner can manage billing and seats. All other plans are single-user. Two tools are limited per day instead of by monthly analyses and do not consume them: SEO Client Finder, limited to 5 searches per day, and AI Regex, limited to 1,000 runs per day — both available on Agency only. We reserve the right to modify plan limits with 30 days' notice.`,
  },
  {
    title: '4. User Obligations',
    body: `You agree to: (a) provide accurate account information; (b) use the Service only for lawful purposes; (c) not share your account credentials with others; (d) not attempt to circumvent usage limits or reverse-engineer the Service; (e) not use automated scripts, bots, or scrapers to abuse the API; (f) not submit content that is illegal, defamatory, or infringes third-party intellectual property rights; (g) not use the Service to generate spam, misinformation, or content that promotes harm. Violation of these obligations may result in immediate account suspension or termination without refund.`,
  },
  {
    title: '5. Payments and Billing',
    body: `Paid plans are billed via DoDo Payments. Starter, Pro, Agency and Agency Plus are each billed either monthly or annually, whichever you choose at checkout; annual subscriptions are charged once a year in advance and cost the equivalent of ten months at the monthly rate, a saving of approximately 17%: Starter $90, Pro $190, Agency $490 and Agency Plus $990 per year. Where a discount code applies to a first billing cycle only, the subscription renews at the full published price after that cycle – on an annual plan that means the discount covers the first year and the second year is charged in full. By subscribing, you authorise recurring charges to your payment method. All prices are in USD. Taxes may apply depending on your location and will be added at checkout. Subscriptions auto-renew at the end of each billing period. You may cancel at any time – you retain access to paid features until the end of your current billing period. No partial refunds are issued for unused time within a billing period, except as outlined in our Refund Policy.`,
  },
  {
    title: '6. Refund Policy',
    body: `Optmizly does not offer a free trial. Paid subscriptions are charged when you subscribe and again at the start of each renewal period. Charges are non-refundable except where required by applicable law, or where a billing error has occurred. You may cancel at any time from your account settings; cancelling stops the next renewal and your access continues until the end of the period you have already paid for. The Free plan requires no payment method and can be used for as long as you like. See our full Refund Policy at /refund-policy.`,
  },
  {
    title: '7. Intellectual Property',
    body: `You retain full ownership of all content you submit for analysis. Optmizly does not claim any rights over your content. By submitting content, you grant Optmizly a limited, non-exclusive licence to process it solely for the purpose of providing the Service. The Optmizly platform, interface, branding, and codebase are proprietary and protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, reproduce, modify, or distribute any part of the platform without our prior written consent.`,
  },
  {
    title: '8. Disclaimer of Warranties',
    body: `The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that any specific SEO results will be achieved. AI-generated content is inherently probabilistic and may contain errors.`,
  },
  {
    title: '9. Limitation of Liability',
    body: `To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Optmizly and its officers, employees, and affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages – including loss of profits, data, business, or goodwill – arising from your use of or inability to use the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total cumulative liability for any claims arising from these terms shall not exceed the greater of (a) the total amount you paid to Optmizly in the 3 months preceding the claim or (b) USD $50.`,
  },
  {
    title: '10. Indemnification',
    body: `You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Optmizly and its affiliates from any claims, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any third-party rights.`,
  },
  {
    title: '11. Termination',
    body: `We may suspend or terminate your account at any time for violation of these Terms, fraudulent activity, or for any other reason with or without notice. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. You may delete your account at any time from account settings. Termination does not entitle you to a refund except as provided under our Refund Policy.`,
  },
  {
    title: '12. Changes to Terms',
    body: `We may update these Terms at any time. We will notify you by email at least 14 days before material changes take effect. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree with changes, you may cancel your subscription before they take effect.`,
  },
  {
    title: '13. Governing Law',
    body: `These Terms are governed by applicable law. Disputes will be resolved through good-faith negotiation first. If unresolved, disputes shall be submitted to binding arbitration where permitted by law. Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under applicable consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction.`,
  },
  {
    title: '14. Contact',
    body: `For questions about these Terms, contact us at legal@Optmizly.com.`,
