> An AI search optimization platform covering SEO, GEO and AEO — auditing, optimizing and monitoring how a website appears both in Google and in the AI systems that now answer on its behalf.

Optmizly exists because being found no longer means one thing. A page can rank on Google and still be unusable to a generative engine, usually because the crawler is blocked in robots.txt, the content only appears after JavaScript runs, or nothing on the page identifies who wrote it. Three kinds of work are involved and they are not interchangeable:

- **SEO** — Search Engine Optimization. Can a search engine crawl, understand and rank the page?
- **GEO** — Generative Engine Optimization. Can a generative engine reach the page, and does anything establish who is behind it? This is where crawler access, author attribution and entity signals matter.
- **AEO** — Answer Engine Optimization. Does a specific question on the page have a self-contained, liftable answer, marked up so a machine can find the pairing?

## Free tools, no account required

These need no signup and no card. Five uses per day each, except the prospect finder,
which is three searches a month because every search buys live business data.

- [Find Your Next SEO Client](${APP_URL}/tools/find-clients): Enter an industry and a city. Checks ten local businesses and returns the ones whose websites have fixable SEO problems, each with an opportunity score and its top issues. For agencies looking for prospects.
- [AI Search Readiness Audit](${APP_URL}/tools/ai-search-readiness): Enter a URL and get a measured readiness score across technical foundation, on-page signals, content extractability, structured data, AEO and GEO — including whether AI answer crawlers are allowed in robots.txt and whether the content survives without JavaScript. Every check is deterministic; nothing is estimated.
- [E-E-A-T Checker](${APP_URL}/tools/eeat): Paste content and score it against Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness, with the specific weaknesses to fix first.
- [AI Regex Generator](${APP_URL}/tools/ai-regex): Describe a pattern in plain English and get a working regular expression, for filtering SEO exports and keyword lists.

## Product

- [Pricing and plan comparison](${APP_URL}/pricing): Current prices, monthly and annual options, per-plan usage limits, the full feature comparison, and answers to what counts as one analysis.
- [Home](${APP_URL}/): What the platform does, how the discover → audit → optimize → generate → monitor workflow fits together, and who each plan suits.
- [Sign up](${APP_URL}/signup): Free plan available with no card.

## Guides
