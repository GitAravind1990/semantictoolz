  {
    title: '1. Paid Plans and Billing',
    body: `Optmizly does not offer a free trial. Starter, Pro, Agency and Agency Plus are paid subscriptions: your payment method is charged when you subscribe, and again at the start of each renewal period. Each paid plan can be billed monthly or annually, whichever you choose at checkout. If you want to try Optmizly without paying, the Free plan requires no payment method and can be used for as long as you like.`,
  },
  {
    title: '2. Cancelling',
    body: `You may cancel at any time from your account settings. Cancelling stops the next renewal; it is not a refund of the period you are currently in. Your access to paid features continues until the end of the period you have already paid for. Charges already taken are non-refundable except where required by applicable law or as described below.`,
  },
  {
    title: '3. Renewals',
    body: `Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period. If you do not wish to be charged for a renewal, you must cancel before the renewal date. Cancelling takes effect at the end of your current billing period, and you retain access to paid features until then. No partial refunds are issued for unused time within a billing period.`,
  },
  {
    title: '4. Billing Errors',
    body: `If you believe you were charged in error – for example, a duplicate charge, or a charge after you cancelled – contact us at support@Optmizly.com with your registered email address and the date of the charge. We will investigate and issue a refund if a billing error is confirmed. We aim to process confirmed refunds within 3–5 business days; depending on your bank or card issuer, it may take an additional 5–10 business days for funds to appear.`,
  },
  {
    title: '5. Chargebacks',
    body: `We ask that you contact us at support@Optmizly.com before initiating a chargeback with your bank or card issuer. Chargebacks are costly and time-consuming for both parties. If a chargeback is filed without prior contact, we reserve the right to suspend your account pending resolution and to contest the chargeback. Fraudulent chargebacks may result in permanent account termination.`,
  },
  {
    title: '6. Consumer Rights',
    body: `Nothing in this Refund Policy limits your statutory rights under applicable consumer protection law. If you are based in the EU or UK, you may have additional rights under the Consumer Rights Directive or Consumer Contracts Regulations, including a statutory cooling-off period for digital services. If you have begun using the Service and subsequently request a cancellation, a proportional deduction may apply under applicable law.`,
  },
  {
    title: '7. Contact',
    body: `For billing questions or refund requests, contact us at support@Optmizly.com. We aim to respond within 1 business day.`,
