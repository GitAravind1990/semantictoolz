 *
 * **This limit is not a cost control.** A client is a database row and costs nothing to
 * keep; all the real spend sits in analyses and prospect searches, which are metered
 * separately and stay metered regardless of client count. That is what makes "unlimited
 * clients" a headline a higher tier can honour honestly and indefinitely, and it is why
 * this cap is a product boundary rather than a ceiling that has to hold under race.
 *
 * A future unlimited tier sets `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` here. Note that
 * `JSON.stringify(Infinity)` is `null`, so any route returning this value must convert it
 * deliberately — see `serializeClientLimit`. Writing that now means the unlimited tier
 * cannot ship a silent `null` into the UI later.

/**
 * How much of the monthly allowance a single run of each tool consumes.
 *
 * Every tool used to cost exactly 1, which meant a content analysis costing nothing and
 * a keyword research costing ~$0.20 in DataForSEO calls drew down the same allowance.
 * Measured against a real invoice (14.07–05.08.2026, $14.00 over ~140 analyses), that
 * left Agency exposed: 200 keyword researches is roughly $40 of cost against $49 of
 * revenue, an 18% gross margin before hosting. Weighting the meter caps that at ~$13
 * without touching headline pricing.
 *
 * The tiers reflect measured cost per run, not effort or perceived value:
 *   3 — heavy DataForSEO: keyword discovery + metrics + intent, bulk backlink lookups,
 *       or a grid of local SERPs. ~$0.15–0.30 a run.
 *   2 — a handful of real API calls. ~$0.05–0.10 a run.
 *   1 — LLM-only, or one or two SERP calls at $0.002 each. Effectively free, since
 *       production runs Groq (see src/lib/llm-pricing.ts).
 *
 * Free-plan tools are all weight 1 on purpose: "3 analyses" must keep meaning three
 * runs, or the plan's public promise changes.
