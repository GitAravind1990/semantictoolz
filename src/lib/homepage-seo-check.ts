/**
 * Fetch one homepage and run deterministic SEO checks over it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a crawler: one request per business, no link following, no sitemap, no
 * robots. This backs SEO Client Finder, whose job is to tell an agency "this local business
 * has fixable problems worth a pitch" - and the homepage carries almost every signal that
 * conversation opens with.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything below:
 *
 * 1. The URLs come from Google Places, which means they are attacker-influenceable in
 *    practice - anyone can list a business with any website. Every fetch is SSRF-guarded,
 *    including each redirect hop. See fetchHomepage.
 * 2. The HTML is UNTRUSTED and never leaves this module as raw text. Only the structured
 *    signals and findings below travel onward. One caveat worth stating precisely rather
 *    than claiming immunity: the page's own <title> is quoted into a finding description,
 *    so a bounded amount of site-authored text does travel. It is capped at 200 characters
 *    for exactly that reason - findings are what reach a model, and a prospect's homepage
 *    should not get to write into a prompt at length.

 * Fetch a homepage, or return null. Never throws, never hangs.
 *
 * The SSRF surface here is wider than it looks. Client Finder's URLs arrive from Google
 * Places, and "not typed by the user" is not "trustworthy" — anyone can list a business
 * with any website. The free readiness audit is more direct still: the URL is typed by a
 * stranger on a public page. So:
 *
 *   - validateUrl() before the first request: the scheme must be http(s), and the hostname
 *     is resolved and refused if any address it returns is loopback, link-local
 *     (169.254.0.0/16, where IMDS lives), RFC1918, CGNAT or otherwise not public.
 *   - safeLookup as the request's `lookup`, which re-runs that check on the address the
 *     socket is actually connecting to. **This is what closes DNS rebinding.** validateUrl
 *     alone cannot: it resolves the name, approves it, and then the connection resolves the
 *     name again — and an attacker running the authoritative server can answer differently
 *     the second time. Because Node resolves through `lookup`, the approved address and the
 *     connected address are now the same event rather than two.
 *   - redirects walked by hand, with validateUrl() on every hop, so a public hostname
 *     cannot bounce to 127.0.0.1 after passing the first check.
 *   - one deadline for the whole operation rather than per hop, so five slow redirects
 *     cannot add up to five timeouts.
